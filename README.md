# Skroid
[logo](bot logo.png)
Skroid is a feature-rich Moderation and Music bot. From Playing music, saying hi, sending dm to advanced level moderation, It is the best bot for small to medium-sized discord servers. It is made using discord.py library. I have credited all the sources at the bottom from where I scraped up the code and knowledge to make this bot. I made this bot for my own purpose but later thought of opening it to public, whoevers wants to contribute for this bot can freely do it, just make a pull request and I will see whether to accept it or not!

Bot prefix - ^

the variables OWNER ID, BOT TOKEN, GOOGLE TOKEN etc are all environment variables which you have to setup on your own.

## Some stuff
Anyways, you can also invite this bot to in your server if you wish - [invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=885529255084163202&permissions=8&scope=bot).

Also don't forget to join my [DISCORD SERVER](https://discord.gg/JRwwfQgjZH) to get frequently notified for my upcoming games and bot updates!
